# Introduction

The IVA User Manual provides instructions on the use of the IVA web application. It is assumed that IVA has been installed and configured for an existing OpenCGA instance. See the [Installation](../admin-guide/installation/) section of the Admin Guide for information on installation. 

IVA is highly configurable so not all details of this manual, which is based on the public OpenCGA at [http://bioinfo.hpc.cam.ac.uk/web-apps/iva-prod](http://bioinfo.hpc.cam.ac.uk/web-apps/iva-prod), will apply to all OpenCGA instances. Other OpenCGA installations may provide their own IVA documentation; here is Genomics England's for instance: [https://research-help.genomicsengland.co.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45024271](https://research-help.genomicsengland.co.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45024271)
